# Most Likely To...

High School Senior Award Generator. Begins at a home page where you can click the button that sends you to the generator. Once the generator is loaded, an 'award' is shown in which you can reroll to get a more desirable response. Using the side bar on the generator page, you can choose between certificates types. You can also click the title at the top of the page to be sent back to the home page. This project is designed for desktop users and will continually be altered to accommodate mobile use as well as to make code more efficient. While not perfect, I built this site to demonstrate basic HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge.
