# Most Likely To...
In this app users get a random "most likely to.." award similar to that of what a senior high school student would be awarded with inside a yearbook.

<h2> How The App Works </h2>
Begins at a home page where you can click the button that sends you to the generator. Once the generator is loaded, an 'award' is shown in which you can reroll to get a more desirable response. Using the side bar on the generator page, you can choose between certificates types. You can also click the title at the top of the page to be sent back to the home page.
